## Project Description

**Description** Module 6 challenge was taking what we learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

---

## Setup:

- Starter codes for both WeatherPy and VacationPy were provided by the challenge module
- I imported the API key from open weathermap.com for the WeatherPy deliverables
- For the VacationPy I imported the csv file that was created from weatherpy.
